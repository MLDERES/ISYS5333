# Choose your own Azure Adventure
Now that you have experienced the Azure platform it's time to dig deep and explore in an area that interests you.  You can take one of the ideas presented below or come up with your own.  The goal is to learn more about Azure and to have fun doing it.

## Ideas
### Explore an Azure Service
- **Azure Functions**: Create a serverless function that is triggered by an HTTP request.  The function should return a random fact about a topic of your choice.
- **Azure Cognitive Services**: Create a web application that uses the Azure Cognitive Services to analyze an image and return information about the image.
- **Azure Logic Apps**: Create a logic app that is triggered by a new file being added to a blob storage container.  The logic app should send an email to a specified address with the contents of the file.
- **Azure Machine Learning**: Create a machine learning model that predicts the price of a house based on a set of features.  Deploy the model as a web service and create a web application that uses the model to predict the price of a house.
  
### Deploy the web app in a different way
- Take the app we deployed in class and deploy it again but using a different method.  For instance,
  - Try deploying it by using SQL as a managed service.
  - Run the SQL Server as a separate VM from the web app.
- Deploy the app using a different database.  For instance, try deploying it using CosmosDB.
- Using one of the existing deployment approaches, try deploying using Bicep or Terraform.

### Become an expert on another area of Azure
- **Azure Security**: Research and describe how to secure an Azure environment.  Include information on how to secure a virtual machine, a web application, and a database.
- **Azure Learning Path**: Pick a learning path in the [Azure Learning Paths](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure/) and complete it.  Report out  on what you learned and how you could apply it to a real-world scenario.  If you choose this option, you should complete the entire learning path and not just a single module.
